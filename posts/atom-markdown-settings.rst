.. TEASER_END

Note:
=====

#. After installing ``markdown-preview-plus``, the built-in package
   ``markdown-preview`` should be disabled.
#. Disable built-in package ``whitespace``: since it will remove
   trailing whitespaces automatically, while two whitespaces are
   necessary in markdown mode. Though you can disable this feature in
   the package settings, it is strongly recommended to disable the
   package because it also affects the performance of Atom in markdown
   mode.
